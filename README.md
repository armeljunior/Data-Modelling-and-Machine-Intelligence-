# Data Modelling and Machine Intelligence
An investigation on different machine learning algorithms to be tested and implemented with data supporting 
the choices behind each decision made. The database contains the sale of properties, as well as various features.
The dataset is made up of 80 different variables, there are 23 nominal and ordinal, 20 continuous, 14 discrete variable
s. The project will be implemented using a mixture of MATLAB as well as Orange 3 data processing. 
The results would be used to experiment the relevance of the
sale price versus all the data in the model to produce the best trustworthy relationship model created

## Pre-processing 

 
Figure 1 Missing 3.4% data
As Figure 1 shows there are 3.4% missing values within the dataset provided. Further analysis of this shows the missing values are from multiple parameters within the data which will need to be either cleaned or fixed using feature engineering.  


There are multiple ways of dealing with missing data however each must be applied specifically to produce the best response otherwise this would destroy the algorithm by making too many adjustments or too few.

Examples of methodologies to fix data:

-	Impute missing data with 
- - Most Frequent values
- - Exploring Correlations
- -	Similarities between Cases
•	Deleting the whole section or column of missing dataa
•	Using mean, median mode to average the results and work out similarities
